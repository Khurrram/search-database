# search-database
Hello!

Here are some features of this application!:

- MongoDB Atlas filled with 1m+ rows!
- Uses Compound Indexing to increase efficiency between searches!
- Material UI is used for styling
- Real Time searching through 1m rows of information, with 12+ different search identifiers!


Here are some updates for the future (aka if I had more time):
- Ability to search via symbols like '>','<','=' for search queries with numbers.
- Added more specific compound indexes to further increase efficiency.
- Tested inputs via Jest or another ReactJS testing library!.
- Used React memoization for filtering on the front-end, further increasing efficiency.

To run the application:
- FORK this repo
- Download forked repo and run npm install in both root folder + frontend folder && npm run dev in root folder
- Open localhost:3000 in your browser
- Change MongoDB config in server/config/db.config.js to your own mongodb atlas! Unfortunately for this challenge, the compound indexes are already saved inside my database! 
- Enjoy!
